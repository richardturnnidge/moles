# moles
Mouse target practice game.
This game is for Agon Console8.

Those pesky moles have been digging up your nice lawn.
It uses the mouse to control your spade.
You have 30 seconds to whack as many as you can with your spade.

I started this game as a way to show the use of a mouse on the Console8, but it just evolved from there.

I will probably add better sound effects at some point.

If you download and enjoy this game, or find the code useful, you could buy me a coffee if you wish:
