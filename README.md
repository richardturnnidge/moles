# moles
Mouse target practice game.

This game is for Agon Console8.

It ses the mouse to control your spade.

Those pesky moles have been diggin up your nice lawn.

You have 30 seconds to whack as many as you can with your spade.

I started this game as a way to show the use of a mouse on the Console8, but it just evolved from there.
